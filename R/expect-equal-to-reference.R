#' Regression test: is the object equal to a reference value stored in a file?
#'
#' This expectation is equivalent to [expect_equal()], except that the
#' expected value is stored in an RDS file instead of being specified literally.
#' This can be helpful when the value is necessarily complex. If the file does
#' not exist then it will be created using the value of the specified object,
#' and subsequent tests will check for consistency against that generated value.
#' The test can be reset by deleting the RDS file.
#'
#' It is important to initialize the reference RDS file within the source
#' package, most likely in the `tests/testthat` directory. Testing spawned
#' by [devtools::test()], for example, will accomplish this. But note that
#' testing spawned by `R CMD check` and [devtools::check()] will NOT.
#' In the latter cases, the package source is copied to an external location
#' before tests are run. The resulting RDS file will not make its way back into
#' the package source and will not be available for subsequent comparisons.
#'
#' @inheritParams expect_that
#' @param file The file name used to store the object. Should have an "rds"
#'   extension.
#' @param label For the full form, a label for the expected object, which is
#'   used in error messages. Useful to override the default (which is based on
#'   the file name), when doing tests in a loop. For the short-cut form, the
#'   object label, which is computed from the deparsed object by default.
#' @param expected.label Equivalent of `label` for shortcut form.
#' @param ... other values passed to [expect_equal()]
